## WELCOME TO MY PASSWORD GENERATOR!!

Here you will find my password generator, the functionality was provided by a combination of my own code and some help from others both in the class and on the tutoring side of it.

## HOW TO USE!!

It's simple, really! All you do is click "Generate Password" and you'll see a few prompts appear, once you confirm ho wlong your password is, you simply click the buttons to confirm your formatting selection. In 6 short clicks, you will have a password!

## DISCLAIMER!!

This is not a secure password generator, do NOT use it for secure programs, this was to show that randomization in JavaScript is possible. I am not responsible for if you use my generator and your password gets compromized! You have been warned!

Much of this code was not created by me only, I had help from several people, who I cannot thank enough. Any extra code you may see in the source code was broken code, which got refined but never deleted. If you wish to download the source code and you try fiddling with the commented out code, I cannot be responsible for it being broken on your end
